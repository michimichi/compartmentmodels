# compartmentmodels

This library provides implementations of three tracer-kinetic models, which are often used for the analysis of DCE MRI data: 

* a two-compartment exchange model
* a two-compartment uptake model and 
* a one-compartment model 

Please see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23563847 for a review of these models.

Currently, this library is under development, but in a usable status. However, the API might be changed without warning, until an official first release is made.

## Usage of this library

Using this library is demonstrated in the accompanying [ipython notebook](https://github.com/michimichi/compartmentmodels/blob/develop/PracticalModelFitting.ipynb)

## Requirements

This package is developed under Python 2.7. Currently, numpy and scipy are required for the numerics and pytest for
the testing suite.

If you use the Anaconda distribution, all required libraries should be on board or should be easy to install.




## Contributing

If you wish to use this library, or if you want to contribute, e.g. by implementing additional models or further features, please contact the author for support.
